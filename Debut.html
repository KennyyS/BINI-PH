           <h1>2018-2020: Formation through Star Hunt Academy</h1>
           
           <p>For many years, believing that "the Filipino talent has a place in the global stage,
            Laurenti Dyogi, ABS-CBN's Head  of <br>Entertainment Production, thought of forming a
            training camp where youth aspiring to become superstars "can develop <br> or further hone their talents."
            In 2018, ABS-CBN launched the Star Hunt Academy program, which had 250 auditionees <br> 
            between the ages of 16 and 19 years old from all over the Philippines. From this pool of auditionees, in addition 
            to <br>recommendations  by talent scouts, the first set of female Star Hunt Academy trainees were selected, which was <br>originally
            composed of 11 girls. While Dyogi initially planned to debut a nine-member idol girl group, the 11 girl trainees <br>were 
            eventually trimmed down to eight girls: Maraiah Queen "Aiah" Arceta, Nicolette "Colet" Vergara, Mary Loi "Maloi" <br>Ricalde,
            Gweneth 'Gwen" Apuli, Stacey Aubrey Sevilleja, Mikhaela "Mikha" Lim, Sheena Mae Catacutan, and Jhoanna <br>Robles. Of 
            the eleven members, two—Sheena and Gwen—were originally housemates from Pinoy Big Brother: Otso.
           </p>

           <br>

           <p>The group was trained from 2018 to 2020 under local coaches, including the professional vocal coach and former chair <br>
            of the Department of Voice,  Music Theater and Dance at the University of the Philippines College of Music, Kitchy Molina,<br>
            and Austrian-born dance coach Mickey Perz, as well as South Korean coaches from MU Doctor Academy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On August 3, 2019, the group as SHA trainees were initially introduced on the online pre-show of the PBB Otso Big Night,<br>
            in which they first performed and were debuted as Star Hunt Academy trainees. They also performed in their first-ever <br>
            mall show in Taguig and at least two ABS-CBN events. where they were proclaimed as Youth Ambassadors, and at the <br>
            2019 Manila Southeast Asian Games thanksgiving celebration.</p>

            <br>

            <p>In May 2020, Dyogi released a performance practice video of the group singing and dancing to "Ngiti" by Young JV and<br>
                Gary Valenciano on Twitter to show their progress in training. In August 2020, the group participated in the Philippine <br>
                K-pop Convention's Happy Hallyu Day 4 event, performing K-pop dance covers, including Red Velvet's In & Out, <br>
                Blackpink's How You Like That and Twice's More & More.</p>
